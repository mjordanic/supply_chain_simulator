## Behavioral guidelines
Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. 

Tradeoff: These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding
Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:
State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

In unattended/orchestrated runs where asking is impossible (e.g. the issue-implementer under `/implement-issues`), "ask" becomes: record the assumption in the commit body and proceed, or report `blocked` — never block waiting on a question.

### 2. Simplicity First
Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

No features beyond what was asked.
No abstractions for single-use code.
No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
No error handling for impossible scenarios.
If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.
Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes
Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:

Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.
When your changes create orphans:

Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.
The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.


### 4. Goal-Driven Execution
Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

"Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
"Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
"Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"
For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

  1. [Step] → verify: [check]
  2. [Step] → verify: [check]
  3. [Step] → verify: [check]
Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.


## Tooling

Use `uv` for all Python tooling — `uv run`, `uv add`, `uv sync`. Never `pip`, `python -m`, or `poetry`.

## Git commits

Do not sign commits with `Co-Authored-By: Claude …` (or any other co-author trailer attributing the commit to Claude/Anthropic or OpenAI or Cursor or any other coding agent). Leave the commit message unsigned. Applies to the main thread and any subagent or skill that creates commits.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and PRDs live as markdown files under `.scratch/<feature>/`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Five canonical triage roles, default strings, recorded as `Status:` lines in each issue file. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

### Implementation orchestrator (project-local, not vendored)

`/implement-issues` drives dependency-ordered, unattended implementation of
`ready-for-agent` issues in a `.scratch/<feature>/` folder. It builds a wave plan, then
dispatches subagents:

- `wave-runner` — runs one wave; owns git worktrees, cherry-pick integration, and report
  updates (a context firewall — only a small summary returns).
- `issue-implementer` — implements one issue via `/tdd`, one commit prefixed `<id>:`, then
  moves the issue file to `issues/done/`.

These are kept tool-agnostic the same way the skills are: the canonical files live under
`.agents/commands/implement-issues.md` and `.agents/agents/{wave-runner,issue-implementer}.md`,
and are symlinked into `.claude/commands/` and `.claude/agents/` so Claude Code discovers them
as a native `/`-command and subagents. Other coding assistants read the `.agents/` copies
directly. (Unlike the skills — which are installed fresh via `npx skills@latest add
mattpocock/skills` and git-ignored — these are project-local and committed to the repo:
not part of the `mattpocock/skills` collection or its `skills-lock.json`.)

Questions are allowed only in Phases 0–1 (preflight + plan); from wave dispatch onward
the run is fully unattended and resumable. Relies on the issue-tracker layout, the five
triage labels, and `/tdd` above. First run audits `.claude/settings.local.json` against
its Required Bash patterns appendix and will prompt once to add any missing `permissions.allow`
entries (local git/filesystem only; the remote-touching deny list stays intact).

## Agent skills (mattpocock/skills)

The `mattpocock/skills` collection is installed **fresh** with the upstream
installer, not vendored into this repo:

```bash
npx skills@latest add mattpocock/skills
```

That writes the skill bodies to `.agents/skills/`, symlinks each into
`.claude/skills/` (so Claude Code discovers them as native `/`-invocable
skills), drops Cursor copies under `.cursor/`, and records a `skills-lock.json`.
All of those are git-ignored by default — re-run the command any time to pull
the latest. To use a skill outside an agent, read `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
and follow it.

Expected after install: diagnose, git-guardrails-claude-code, grill-me,
grill-with-docs, handoff, improve-codebase-architecture, prototype,
request-refactor-plan, setup-matt-pocock-skills, tdd, teach, to-issues, to-prd,
triage, write-a-skill, writing-fragments, writing-shape, zoom-out.

Note: `teach`, `zoom-out`, and `setup-matt-pocock-skills` are manual-only
(`disable-model-invocation: true`) — invoke them explicitly.
